###Interesting ones to work on
1. Classification (ok with localization but not detection)
	+ [Caltech 101](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/) 131mb, matlab format annotation, have contour and 1 bounding box, not sure if it is enough for deep learning, have a 256 version
	+ [Flower](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/) 60mb, png mask for segmentation (part), i cannot find classification labels, but it seems sorted, some files in matlab format, have a 102 version
	+ [Stanford Dogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) 800mb, original dataset have xml format bounding box, makes it perfect for localization
	+ [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) 173mb 13233 images 5749 people 1680 people with two or more images, also 1500 images have segmentation mask, many classes small sample
	+ [Pubfig Faces](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/pubfig/)
	+ [Weizmann horses](http://www.msri.org/people/members/eranb/) 328 side-view color images of horses that were manually segmented. Maybe good for start semantic segmentation
	+ [LAG: Large Age Gap](http://www.ivl.disco.unimib.it/activities/large-age-gap-face-verification/) The dataset contains 3,828 images of 1,010 celebrities. For each identity at least one child/young image and one adult/old image are present. 200mb, interesting dataset, not sure what to do with it
	+ [SCUT-FBP5500-Database-Release](https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-FBP5500-Database-Release) Good for GANs, generate face

	
2. Video Classification 
	+ [e-VDS](https://engineering.purdue.edu/elab/eVDS/) 900 files, 660mb, 10s mp4, 33 classes
	+ [Densely Annotated VIdeo Segmentation](http://davischallenge.org/index.html) 2gb, single or multiple object
	+ [UCF50](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF50.php) 3gb, also have some others

3. Object Detection, Instance Segmentation
	+ [PASCAL VOC 2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/index.html) 2gb object detection, segmentation, person layout
